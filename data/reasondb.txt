I like cheese
I am hungry
My mom wants food
I want Mexican candy
Because it is my dad's birthday
We are getting new furniture
I love green things
Because you are the best
My girlfriend needs this tart pan
Girl wants to cook fish
Potato chips are tasty
This is a nutritious dish
Jackson enjoys whales
You like bottles
We love to go skiing
Our plants need to be watered
Derek and your mom are having sex
I feel quite hungry
All my friends have one, I have to have it!
Andrew got one and it was really cool.
It tastes good and I'm hungry
It looks cool
It has positive reviews
The shirt looks really soft
Boba pearls are really chewy
I want to pick my brother's lock
To fight the patriarchy
The bottle looks very refined
My computer died and I need a new one
The extra buttons would be really useful
I want a new poster for my room
Vinyls are now cool
I don't want to hear these normies in the background
Our dad's birthday is next week
We love how it complements our wallpaper
His head gets sunburned so he could use this
Her breath smells and it bothers me
We have been looking for a good blender for months
Our baby always cries at night
I need a textbook to learn javascript
Her hair gets frizzy in the morning
Vegan shampoo speaks to our humanity
My back hurts recently
Her cosplay event is next week and she needs a tattoo
His facial hair is too long and it bothers me
Our old water bottle got dirty
We could use a whiteboard for studying
The necklace looks really pretty
